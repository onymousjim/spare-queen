- Never make any commits.  i will tell you when to commit
- When I type "commmit it", that means stage all files, and commit them
- When I type "ship it", that means stage all files, commit them, then push
- When I type "run it"  the means restart the backend and frontend of the application using the restart-all.sh script
- Never restart all of nodejs because it disconnects me from this ubuntu wsl instance in vs code.  Instead, when you need to restart node applications, target the specific port running the application
- create a script call restart-all that restarts the backend and frontend of the application and use that any time you need to restart either
- do not write any markdown files anywhere
